                \item[\bullet]{Talk about what the project was about and what we/I did, what skills were required (developed software in C to simulate how photons can interact with planetary atmospheres to produce light curves, which could be applied to exoplanets to infer composition. Used Monte Carlo random sampling and parallelization)}

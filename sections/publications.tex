\begin{cvhonors} % These aren't honours, obviously, but the formatting for entries in this environment are about right for publications. Just need to remove rogue commas

    \cvhonor{}{Searches for semi-visible jets in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV in hadronic final states}{In preparation}{2020}

    \cvhonor{}{Search for an invisibly decaying Higgs boson in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV in final states with jets and missing transverse momentum}{In preparation}{2020}

    \cvhonor{}{Search for natural and split supersymmetry in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV in final states with jets and missing transverse momentum}{JHEP}{2018}

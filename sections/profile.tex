\cvsection{Profile}

\begin{cvparagraph}
    I am a data scientist at a fulfilment and technology startup, involved in a diverse array of projects from sales forecasting to economic analyses.
    In a previous role, I developed a web scraping pipeline for the Consumer Price Index alternative data sources transformation.
    I completed a PhD in particle physics, searching for dark matter using big data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN\@.
    Involving statistical analysis of large datasets with expertise in Python, I solved wide-ranging problems from physics standpoints to programming challenges.
    Aside from work, I partake in many activities such as taekwondo, weight lifting, hiking, and skiing.

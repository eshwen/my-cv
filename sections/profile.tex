\cvsection{Profile}

\begin{cvparagraph}
I am a final year PhD student in particle physics, searching for dark matter using big data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) as part of the CMS experiment at CERN. This involves statistical analysis of large datasets, primarily in Python, and solving wide ranging problems from physics to programming standpoints. Additional responsibilities have included detector-related expertise and software development, teaching undergraduates and doing public outreach. Aside from work, I partake in many activities such as taekwondo, weight lifting, hiking and skiing.

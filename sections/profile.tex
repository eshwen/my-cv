\cvsection{Profile}

\begin{cvparagraph}
    I am a data scientist developing a web scraping pipeline for the Consumer Price Index alternative data sources transformation.
    I have completed a PhD in particle physics, searching for dark matter using big data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN\@.
    This involved statistical analysis of large datasets with expertise in Python, and solving wide-ranging problems from physics standpoints to programming challenges.
    Additional responsibilities included providing detector-related expertise and software, teaching undergraduates, and public outreach.
    Aside from work, I partake in many activities such as taekwondo, weight lifting, hiking, and skiing.

\cvsection{Skills}

  % ADD AT LEAST SOME OF THE FOLLOWING:
  % LEADERSHIP (ORGANISING AND HELPING OUT JUNIOR PHD STUDENTS AND DELEGATING ASPECTS OF ANALYSIS)
  % COMMUNICATION: GIVING TALKS/PUBLIC SPEAKING (REGULAR WORKING GROUP MEETING, SEVERAL RESEARCH GROUP AND COLLABORATION-WIDE TALKS, POSTERS, CONFERENCE TALKS)
  % OTHER STUFF: ON-CALL EXPERT FOR A CMS DETECTOR SUBSYSTEM (CALO LAYER-2) WHILE BASED AT CERN. UNDERTAKEN SHIFTS TO MONITOR AND MAINTAIN ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL SYSTEMS (LEVEL-1 TRIGGER) DURING DATA TAKING WHILE BASED AT CERN.
  % Could potentially list the above with \cvskill command, giving the skill as the first argument and a brief description as the second. Or I can try just listing everything in bullet points (similar to \cventry command but without the extra stuff. Or maybe they can be laid out like the Projects section in https://github.com/eshwen/my-cv/blob/74d372eecd96525d0c85c50d93380084f1d83a93/cv.pdf (code to typeset it: https://github.com/eshwen/my-cv/blob/74d372eecd96525d0c85c50d93380084f1d83a93/sections/projects.tex)

% Consider adding publications somewhere as well. Can update when SVJ and Hinv papers are published.
% Consider booking appointment with Careers Service when CV is done so they can check it (see http://www.bristol.ac.uk/careers/cv-application/). Also send around to other people (parents, other colleagues, Henning and Joel?)

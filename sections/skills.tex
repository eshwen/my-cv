\begin{cvskills}
    \cvskill
        {Programming Languages} % Type
        {Python, C, C++, YAML, LaTeX} % Skillset

    \cvskill
        {Visualisation}
        {Matplotlib, ROOT, Octave}

  % ADD AT LEAST SOME OF THE FOLLOWING:
  % ORGANISATION (ORGANISING ASPECTS OF ANALYSIS AND DOCUMENTING METICULOUSLY)
  % DATA ANALYSIS WITH BIG DATA (DATA FROM LARGE HADRON COLLIDER - MULTI-TERABYTE DATASETS USED TO PERFORM ANALYSES IN THE SEARCH FOR NEW PARTICLES. DEVELOPED ANALYSIS SOFTWARE IN PYTHON, UTILISING MODERN DATA SCIENCE TOOLS AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING ON COMPUTING GRIDS. VISUALISATION WITH ROOT AND MATPLOTLIB. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS)
  % LEADERSHIP (ORGANISING AND HELPING OUT JUNIOR PHD STUDENTS AND DELEGATING ASPECTS OF ANALYSIS)
  % COMMUNICATION: GIVING TALKS/PUBLIC SPEAKING (REGULAR WORKING GROUP MEETING, SEVERAL RESEARCH GROUP AND COLLABORATION-WIDE TALKS, POSTERS, CONFERENCE TALKS)
  % MULTITASKING (WORKING ON MULTIPLE PROJECTS WITH DIFFERENT WORKING GROUPS AT THE SAME TIME)
  % TEACHING UNDERGRADUATES (MATHEMATICS FOR PHYSICS AND COMPUTING IN PYTHON, THOUGH MAYBE I COULD INSTEAD LET THE 'EXPERIENCE' SECTION SHOWCASE IT)
  % TEAMWORK (BEING PART OF SEVERAL WORKING GROUPS (~ A DOZEN PEOPLE EACH), AS WELL AS A WIDER COLLABORATION (~3500 PEOPLE).
  % PROBLEM SOLVING: PREDOMINANT COMPONENT OF A PHYSICS DEGREE. IN UNDERGRAD, MORE TRADITIONAL PROBLEM SOLVING WITH PEN AND PAPER OR IN A LAB. IN PHD, SOLVING PROBLEMS NUMERICALLY WITH CODE.
  % OTHER STUFF: PEER-REVIEWING PAPERS IN THE COLLABORATION BEFORE PUBLICATION. ON-CALL EXPERT FOR A CMS DETECTOR SUBSYSTEM (CALO LAYER-2) WHILE BASED AT CERN. UNDERTAKEN SHIFTS TO MONITOR AND MAINTAIN ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL SYSTEMS (LEVEL-1 TRIGGER) DURING DATA TAKING WHILE BASED AT CERN.
  % Could potentially list the above with \cvskill command, giving the skill as the first argument and a brief description as the second. Or I can try just listing everything in bullet points (similar to \cventry command but without the extra stuff. Or maybe they can be laid out like the Projects section in https://github.com/eshwen/my-cv/blob/74d372eecd96525d0c85c50d93380084f1d83a93/cv.pdf (code to typeset it: https://github.com/eshwen/my-cv/blob/74d372eecd96525d0c85c50d93380084f1d83a93/sections/projects.tex)
  % For programming languages and visualisation skills, could lay them out in the same way as the other skills above. C, LaTeX and Octave I learned during undergrad, built on LaTeX in PhD
\end{cvskills}

% Consider adding publications somewhere as well. Can update when SVJ and Hinv papers are published.
% Consider booking appointment with Careers Service when CV is done so they can check it. Also send around to other people (parents, other colleagues, Henning and Joel?)

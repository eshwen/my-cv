    \cvskill
        {Programming Languages} % Type
        {Python, C, C++, YAML, LaTeX} % Skillset

    \cvskill
        {Visualisation}
        {Matplotlib, ROOT, Octave}

  % ADD AT LEAST SOME OF THE FOLLOWING:
  % LEADERSHIP (ORGANISING AND HELPING OUT JUNIOR PHD STUDENTS AND DELEGATING ASPECTS OF ANALYSIS)
  % COMMUNICATION: GIVING TALKS/PUBLIC SPEAKING (REGULAR WORKING GROUP MEETING, SEVERAL RESEARCH GROUP AND COLLABORATION-WIDE TALKS, POSTERS, CONFERENCE TALKS)
  % TEACHING UNDERGRADUATES (MATHEMATICS FOR PHYSICS AND COMPUTING IN PYTHON, THOUGH MAYBE I COULD INSTEAD LET THE 'EXPERIENCE' SECTION SHOWCASE IT)
  % PROBLEM SOLVING: PREDOMINANT COMPONENT OF A PHYSICS DEGREE. IN UNDERGRAD, MORE TRADITIONAL PROBLEM SOLVING WITH PEN AND PAPER OR IN A LAB. IN PHD, SOLVING PROBLEMS NUMERICALLY WITH CODE.
  % OTHER STUFF: PEER-REVIEWING PAPERS IN THE COLLABORATION BEFORE PUBLICATION. ON-CALL EXPERT FOR A CMS DETECTOR SUBSYSTEM (CALO LAYER-2) WHILE BASED AT CERN. UNDERTAKEN SHIFTS TO MONITOR AND MAINTAIN ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL SYSTEMS (LEVEL-1 TRIGGER) DURING DATA TAKING WHILE BASED AT CERN.
  % Could potentially list the above with \cvskill command, giving the skill as the first argument and a brief description as the second. Or I can try just listing everything in bullet points (similar to \cventry command but without the extra stuff. Or maybe they can be laid out like the Projects section in https://github.com/eshwen/my-cv/blob/74d372eecd96525d0c85c50d93380084f1d83a93/cv.pdf (code to typeset it: https://github.com/eshwen/my-cv/blob/74d372eecd96525d0c85c50d93380084f1d83a93/sections/projects.tex)
  % For programming languages and visualisation skills, could lay them out in the same way as the other skills above. C, LaTeX and Octave I learned during undergrad, built on LaTeX in PhD

    \cvskill
        {Data analysis}
        {The primary aspects of my PhD involve statistical analysis of large (multi-terabyte) datasets collected by the CMS experiment from the Large Hadron Collider. Developed analysis software in Python and C++, using modern data science tools and distributed computing. Visualisation with ROOT and matplotlib}

    \cvskill
        {Multitasking}
        {Working on multiple projects at a time, often with different working groups.}

    \cvskill
        {Organisation}
        {Coordinating different aspects of analyses in my PhD, meticulously documenting programming instructions and procedures of analysis components.}

    \cvskill
    {Collaboration}
    {Belonging to several working groups of around a dozen people as well as a wider collaboration of over 4,000 people.}

% Consider adding publications somewhere as well. Can update when SVJ and Hinv papers are published.
% Consider booking appointment with Careers Service when CV is done so they can check it (see http://www.bristol.ac.uk/careers/cv-application/). Also send around to other people (parents, other colleagues, Henning and Joel?)

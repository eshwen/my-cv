## Instructions

Clone this repository. If running with, e.g., TeXLive on macOS, you will need to install the `Roboto` fonts. Just double-click on the `.ttf` files in [fonts/](fonts/) and they will install. The fonts may be installed by default if using an online editor like Overleaf (though I haven't tested whether this is true).
